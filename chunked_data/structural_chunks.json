JPSL has put in place a dedicated and well trained help desk to handle QRCFs received from the customers. The timeframe for resolution of QRCF is communicated by the Helpdesk to the customers through available channels. QRCF is classified based on the voice of the customers. The grievance redressal system implemented by JPSL covers various stages of transaction life cycle, different types of disputes, reason codes, process of dispute resolution, documentation required, escalation in case of unsatisfactory response, roles and responsibilities of various parties to the transaction, TAT for each stage, etc. The outcome of the grievance redressal mechanism is binding on all system participants.
